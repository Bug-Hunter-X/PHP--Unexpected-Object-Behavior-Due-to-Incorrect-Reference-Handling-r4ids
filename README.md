# PHP Object Reference Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, subtle bug in PHP related to object references and how they behave when objects are passed as arguments to functions. The `bug.php` file shows the erroneous code that leads to unexpected behavior. The correct solution is presented in `bugSolution.php`.  This example highlights the importance of understanding pass-by-reference semantics when working with objects in PHP to avoid unintended side effects.
